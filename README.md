# Repo for collecting auto-generated issues from the [Mathematica Plugin for IntelliJ](https://github.com/halirutan/Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin)

This is a fake repository that does not contain any code. Instead, it was set up to collect the issues for the Mathematica IntelliJ Plugin that were automatically created when an exception occurs.
